This repositiory contains my personal Java solutions to questions in Gayle McDowell's [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1539140733&sr=1-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview+6th) book and some other algorithm/data structure questions from [GeeksforGeeks dot org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

## CHAPTER 1 - Arrays and Strings
### Data Structure (Implemented)
* Hashmap
### Questions
* ***Question 1:*** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
  * Use a character counter array (e.g if characters are just ACSCII i.e 256 possible characters)
  * Use a 26 bit variable (e.g if character range is just a-z) 
  * Use a hash map
* ***Question 2:*** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
  * Sort both strings and search linearly for uniformity
  * Use character count
  * Find all possible palindromes of string a, check if it matches sting b (Not a recommended solution)
* ***Question 3:*** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters.
  * Start replacement from the back of the string (right to left)
* ***Question 4:*** Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
  * Use character count with regards to uniqueness in even and odd length palindrome.
* ***Question 5:*** Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
* ***Question 6:*** Write a function to perform run length coding on a string
  * Iterate through string taking note of the previous char. onChange, append currentcount and restart new count.
* ***Question 7:*** write a method to rotate an NxN matrix by 90 degrees
* ***Question 8:*** Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
* ***Question 9:*** Given two strings, sl and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of sl using only one call to isSubstring
  * Rotation here simply means left or right shift. Just as is done in binary

## CHAPTER 2 - Linked Lists
### Data Structure (Implemented)
* Singly Linked List
### Questions
* ***Question 1:*** Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
  * Use Hashmap
* ***Question 2:*** Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
* ***Question 3:*** Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
  * Shift subsequent node to current node, until end of list is reached
* ***Question 4:*** Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.
  * Iterate through list, add lesser elements to the head and bigger or equal elements to tail. Link head and tail properly at the end
* ***Question 5:*** You have two numbers represented by a linked list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
  * Pad both list to make sure they are same length before starting the add operation 
* ***Question 6:*** Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
  * Use a stack
  * 0(N) time: iterate to the middle of the list, Create two pointers at this stage. Make pointer a race back towards head while pointer b race forwards towards tail. At each hop of the race, they should always have the same content if the list is a true palindrome. Take not of slight modification needed for even length palindromes. 
* ***Question 7:*** Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting
node.
  * Pad both linked list to same size. Begin iteration from the head of both list. If intersection exists, the two pointers for list a and list b will eventually meet.
* ***Question 8:*** Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
  * Use runner technique i.e pointer b running 2x as fast as pointer a. to determine. At first intersection revert pointer a back to head of list, begin incrementing pointer a and b 1 step per time. The point of next intersection is the begining of the loop.
