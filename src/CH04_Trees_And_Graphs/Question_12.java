 * <b>Paths with Sum:</b> You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which
 * might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a
 * given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
 * (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
