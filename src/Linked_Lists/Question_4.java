 * <b>Partition:</b> Write code to partition a linked list around a value x,
 * such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal
 * to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be
 * after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can
 * appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between
 * the left and right partitions.
